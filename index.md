Welcome to Dan Andrews' GIT Hub Pages. This site is written using Jekyll and markdown (kramdown)
and maintained in GIT Hub. I'm including some of my coding experiments, which I hope to use to 
develop best practices. Comments and suggestions are welcome, but I might not get back to everyone.
Happy coding!
