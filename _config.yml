# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.

# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

  Welcome to my coding adventures in .Net, c#, and .Net Core.
  I started looking at Visual Studio 2019 version 16.2 Preview 2 and
  .Net Core 3.0 preview6 and this is about my experience that followed.
  Originally a Java programmer, I've now been coding in .Net since 2008. 
  I'm new to .Net Core 3.0, but isn't everyone?
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
